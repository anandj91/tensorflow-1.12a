This branch contains all memory reduction tricks, including
1) partitioning and scheduling
  - partitioning strategy
  -- first, schedule operations that have an input that's computed in the current or the previous iteration
  -- among them, prioritize the ones that have a higher rank (length of longest path to sink)
  -- if none is available, schedule the highest ranked node
2) place variables and constants on CPU memory
3) do not reuse send/recv pairs
