This branch contains all memory reduction tricks. Including
1) partitioning and scheduling
  - the graph partitioning strategy
  -- compute the rank of each node which is the length of the longest path from this node to sink
  -- prioritize nodes that have higher ranks
2) place variables and constants on CPU memory
3) no reusing send/recv pairs
